In order of largest to smallest.

1. Population	- a community of organisms, among whose members interbreeding occurs. Collection 		  of Genomes.
2. Genome 	- a collection of chromosomes.
3. Chromosome 	- a collection of genes.
4. Gene 	- a unit of heredity that is transferred from a parent to offspring and is held 		  to determine some characteristic of the offspring.

When reffering to a Genetic Algorithm problem.

1. Population	- A set of solution sets.
2. Species	- A Genome that is far different from other genomes
3. Genome	- A set of solutions.
4. Chromosome	- A solution.
5. Gene		- A variable.

A Species will be defined as a Genome that is far different from the previous genomes.
Essentially when the variance from one Genome to the next is higher than the average variance
from all genomes before it in the current generation.
